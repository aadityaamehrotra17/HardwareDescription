# Hardware Description

This repository contains a collection of Verilog code samples and projects for digital design and FPGA development. Whether you are a beginner learning Verilog or an experienced developer, you'll find useful resources here.

## Verilog Projects

## Introduction

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level (RTL).

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need a Verilog simulator and, if applicable, FPGA synthesis tools. Here are a few recommended tools:

- [ModelSim](https://www.mentor.com/products/fv/modelsim/) - A popular simulation tool.
- [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) - For Xilinx FPGA development.
- [Altera Quartus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html) - For Intel FPGA development.

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aadityaamehrotra17/HardwareDescription.git
```

Navigate to the project branch:

```bash
git checkout branchName
```
Make sure to replace 'branchName' with the actual project name (eg: trafficLight).
Follow the instructions in each project's README file to run it on your system.
